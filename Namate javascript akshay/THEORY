"JAVASCRIPT IS A SYNCHRONOUS SINGLE- THREADED LANGAUGE"

<> MEMORY  component
    also known as variable component

    memory component contains variables and function as the key-value pairs.

<> Code component
    also known as thread of execution

    code component is the place where the whole js code is executed.


"Everthing in JAVASCRIPT happens inside an global execution context","all are called in call stack"

<1st> memory creation phase.

    we allocate memory  to all the variables and functions inside the global phase 

<2nd> code creation phase.
    js code is executed line by line


"function invocation"
    function are the heart of JAVASCRIPT


"Call stack maintains the order of execution of Execution context"

    <>Other name of call stack.
        <>execution context stack
        <>program stack
        <>runtime stack
        <>machine stack
        <>control stack


<>WHAT IS  window or GLOBAL OBJECT ?
    window  is the global object which is created along with the global execution context

    whenever a JAVASCRIPT program is run a global execution context is created along with global object and THIS variable is created

'anything which is not inside in function .or things declare outside the function is known as global space '

"after declaring new var in the code those directly connect it to global object or windows "

<>what is the shortest JAVASCRIPT code?
    1. 
    
    yes a blank line .it will create global object with this keyword.

"JAVASCRIPT is an losely or flexible or weakly  typed LANGAUGE"

    it means it does not attaches it variables with specific datatype, suppose if i created var a and put string in it later on i can 
    put it  number  in it , boolean in it 

"lexical memory is the local memory along with thelexical memoryof its parent"

"SCOPE means where you can access a specific variable or a function in our code "

"the whole chain of lexical environment is scope chain"
